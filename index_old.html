			<p>The past few months of my game development journey have had quite the musical theme to them. I’m trying to write more dev-logs, so it seemed like a good topic to discuss. I mention a lot of music today and I'll be linking/embedding where you can listen to it as we go along, but everything will also be linked at the end for simplicity's sake

			<p>About a year ago, I partook in the Game Maker’s Toolkit Game Jam which was my first game jam experience. It was quite the journey and you can read all about it in this dev-log. I learned a lot, and with an additional year of game development experience under my belt, I figured I should try my hand at another jam. That has now taken place and this dev-log will be my reflection on it just like last time

Though it is taking quite a bit of time, the battle system is getting closer and closer to it’s final iterations mechanics-wise and there is now a plan for almost everything that will be in the final game. It is all seriously starting to come together and even though there is still a lot of work to do, I’m really excited for how it is shaping up
