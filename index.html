		<div class="post_body">
			<p>Update 7 added one of my favorite new features to the game, speed. It does exactly what it sounds like, it determines how fast you move along the timeline. However, ever since its addition into the game speed has become a big hurdle to overcome anytime I want to make any changes to it. This dev-log (which is a semi continuation from Dev-Log #3) explains why this is and how it works

			<p>I am happy to say that (for the most part) the inventory system is done for now! Update 7 was based all around the inventory system and while it worked well, I still needed some refining to

			<p>Update 7 of Project Phases was a huge update. I managed to add lots of new systems involving the inventory, stats and speed. I also refined many of the mechanics already in the game to make them work better and more consistently. Overall, it’s my best update yet as every update should

		<div class="post_body">
			<p>Hello everyone. Welcome to the new website! This is the first dev-log on here explaining why I made this website and the process of making it. First, let me explain what the Dev-Logs are. I will make a dev-log when I want to talk about something that is related to Project Phases. It doesn’t have to be directly related to phases, like a discussion on game mechanicalness in general would count. Since this website is all about Phases, explaining its creation is a dev-log. Hope that makes sense......<a href="posts/devlog/devlog1.html">Read More</a>

			<p>Okay, if you are a musician on YouTube listen up because I got something to say to you. If all your music is exclusively on YouTube and not on any other platform, you need to fix that now. I use Spotify daily and it works great. Spotify is meant for music and it does music very well. YouTube is meant for videos and it does videos very well. YouTube is not meant for music, so it doesn’t do music very
				well.....<a href="posts/other/youtubeartists.html">Read More</a>

		<div class="post_body">
			<p>The Tales series is a long running franchise developed by Bandai Namco. Previous entries include Tales of Symphonia, Tales of Vesperia, and this game’s “sequel” (I’ll get to that later) Tales of Zestiria. I’ve never had the chance to play a Tales game until now. Berseria has been on my wish-list for months now, just waiting for a heavy enough discount to feel like picking up. When it was included in the Humble Monthly, I felt like it was time to try out the Tales game and see what it is 		all about.....<a href="posts/reviews/talesofberseria.html">Read More</a>

			<p>I must admit, this title is a bit of a lie. This is my third time playing Valkyria Chronicles, starting back from the beginning to see if the game will finally click for me. For some reason, I’ve never been able to get into this game. I am going to try one more time and see if I can get through this game, so here are my current First Impression (more like third impressions really)
