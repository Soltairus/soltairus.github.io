			<p>Hey everyone! Anyone who has been paying attention to my Twitter would have noticed I have posted a lot about the Player Future Arrow. In this dev-log, I hope to explain what that is and what it can add to the game. I also am going to explain some issues I have encountered while developing it.

			<p>Hey everyone! A little while ago, I made a dev-log about the new icons I made for Phases. You can check out the original post here. Basically, anything that was previously displayed by text has been switch to an icon. However, there are still a few icons yet to be made, like Buffs and Debuffs. So here are some new icons for those

			<p>Hello everyone! Today I have a more art based dev-log. I am going to talk about the new icons, the process of making them and the few interesting problems that popped up.Let me start by explaining what I mean by icon. Within pretty much all the menus in the game, stats are shown. These stats could be for characters, weapons, armor, etc. Before, I just had letters representing theses stats. For example, “P” was points and “D” was defense

			<p>Update 7 added one of my favorite new features to the game, speed. It does exactly what it sounds like, it determines how fast you move along the timeline. However, ever since its addition into the game speed has become a big hurdle to overcome anytime I want to make any changes to it.

I will make a dev-log when I want to talk about something that is related to Project Phases. It doesn’t have to be directly related to phases, like a discussion on game mechanicalness in general would count. Since this website is all about Phases, explaining its creation is a dev-log.

Berseria has been on my wish-list for months now, just waiting for a heavy enough discount to feel like picking up.
