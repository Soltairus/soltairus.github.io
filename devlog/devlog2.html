  <p>
    Update 7 of Project Phases was a huge update. I managed to add lots of new systems involving the inventory, stats and speed. I also refined many of the mechanics already in the game to make them work better and more consistently. Overall, it’s my best update yet as every update should be.
    <br>
    <br>
    I’ve been thinking over (while making this website) what is next for Phases. I am not saying I am out of ideas or things to add; to the contrary, I have everything mapped out. A while back ago I made a list that planned out every update to Update 10. Update 10 is my last planned update before I start making a game out of Project Phases, rather than a glorified tech-demo (which is what it is now). If I stick to this list, Updates 8 and 9 are relatively small updates. However, you must note that I only had two updates within the whole span of 2018 so “relatively quickly” right now means anything less than six months. <br>
    <br>
    Update 8 is a lot refining, adding smaller subtle additions and Update 9 is making more of what we already have like more attacks, enemies and areas to explore. Update 10 is going to end with me releasing a demo, the final version of the game under the name Project Phases. At that point, I can get more feedback from you and work that into the final game. Right now however, that isn’t a priority, so we will cross that bridge when we get there.
    <br>
    <br>
    As far as I know, the game isn’t going to change all too much functionally between Update 7 and Update 10. My main objective with these last few Updates is to not make the game feel shallow, beef it up with more of everything. I think once I get new enemies and new areas, the game will be a lot more interesting. I have been walking around the same place and fighting the same enemies for two years, so some new content is really what the game needs right now.
    <br>
    <br>
    I hope that all makes sense. Quick TLDR; Update 8 and 9 are focused on refining and adding new content. Update 10 will be the last update (hopefully) and I will release a demo for Phases at that time. From there I will get feedback and start working on the main game.
    <br>
    <br>
    This dev-log is to let you know the plan for a while. I don’t want to set a schedule, but if Update 10 isn’t out by the end of this year I will be a bit worried. Hopefully, it doesn’t go that far. Keep me in check guys!
