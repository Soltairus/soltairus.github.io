		<p>It’s time for another dev-log, this time I’m going to go over some progress updates for Update 10. It has been coming along well, but there is still plenty of work to do before it is finished. Due to the fact that at some point soon I will have to be secretive about progress to avoid spoilers, I want to make sure I get as much info as I can out there before that time comes. So today we will be going over some of the new things that have been added since Update 9

		<p>I recently participated in the Game Maker’s Toolkit Game Jam 2021 and I thought I would write a dev-log to reflect on my experience. This is the first game jam I’ve ever done and I have a lot of thoughts. Also, this is the first dev-log I’ve written that’s not about Project Phases, but don’t worry, Phases is developing smoothly and may be getting a dev-log of it’s own relatively

Basically, anything that was previously displayed by text has been switch to an icon. However, there are still a few icons yet to be made, like Buffs and Debuffs. So here are some new icons for those

I am going to talk about the new icons, the process of making them and the few interesting problems that popped up.Let me start by explaining what I mean by icon. Within pretty much all the menus in the game, stats are shown. These stats could be for characters, weapons, armor, etc. Before, I just had letters representing theses stats. For example, “P” was points and “D” was defense

I will make a dev-log when I want to talk about something that is related to Project Phases. It doesn’t have to be directly related to phases, like a discussion on game mechanicalness in general would count. Since this website is all about Phases, explaining its creation is a dev-log.
