    Hello everyone, this is Update 1 to Project Phases. It focuses on the new resolution and display system and all of the changes that go along with that. I am going to break this up into different sections to make it a bit more readable. Alright, let's go.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Main Menu Changes</h2>
    The first change is tiny, the logo on the main screen is slightly different. Big change, I know.
    First big thing, is the new resolution system. The game used to run at 1920x1080 and just display at that resolution, now the game runs at 640x360. I did this for a couple of reasons, the biggest one is the size of sprites. If I kept the old resolution, every sprite I made would have to be upscaled which could get big both in physical and storage size. Running at a lower resolution and upscaling makes more sense since the sprites can be 32x32 and stay that way which makes things a lot more manageable. At the moment, only 16:9 aspect ratios work and you can change your resolution (in windowed mode) in the setup menu within the main menu.

		<br>
		<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Overworld Changes</h2>
    Next up, overworld changes. First off, the background is one giant stripe. This is because I was testing the resolution changes, and that stripe helped me do it. I meant to change it before the update, but I completely forgot. Next, the enemy doesn’t move around like he did in the overview simply because chasing him down started to become annoying. The game also looks bit more zoomed in due to the resolution change. I may change the camera zoom later to be a bit more zoomed out, but for now it looks good.

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Battle Changes</h2>
    Jumping into a battle, you can see the biggest new change which the new menu. The menu is now in the center and has been completely redesigned to adjust to the new resolution. I also moved it to help lay out the battle for the future for when I have multiple player combat in the game. The menu got upgraded in a few different ways. The menu now holds five attacks instead of three and there are some new icons to help identify what the numbers mean in the menu. There is also a new box on the bottom that serves no purpose now, but I plan to use eventually.
    Some smaller changes are if you end your turn without choosing any moves, you automatically wait. Also, if get attacked in your attack phase you will take damage, but won't get knocked to your next phase. Finally of course, there are a bunch of bug fixes, but a lot of new bugs too.

    <br>
    And that’s Update 1, it isn’t a massive update but changing the resolution did mean I had to change many different aspects of the game. The next update will be an updated overworld, which should be fun.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thank you for reading,
    <br>
