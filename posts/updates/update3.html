    <h3>NOTE FROM FUTURE ANDY- This is by far the most pointless update, since I pretty much completely removed or change everything I did in this update in <a href="update5.html">Update 5</a>. I mostly did this because the system was so predictable and simplistic as you will see. So, anything you read here doesn’t apply to the game anymore. Just an FYI, continue reading if you want. Thanks.</h3>

    Welcome back everybody to Update 3 of Project Phases. This update primarily focuses on Enemy AI and some changes to the battle system. So, let’s get started!
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Overworld Changes</h2>
    There is only one change to the overworld. In the top right corner of the screen, under your health there is a point counter. Your points now carry over from battle to battle and just like your health, your points get replenished when you touch the heart.
    <br>
    <br>
		<img src="../../images/Updates/Update 3/update3_health.PNG" alt="Health in the top right corner"  style="width:50%; height:50%; display: block;">
		<br>
    <h2>Battle Changes</h2>
    The enemy is where most of the changes have been made. First off, the enemy now has a point counter as well. This means he must follow the rules of the point system just like you do.
    The enemy also has a bunch of AI parameters that all depend on what phase you are in. Here is a list of the different rules and such that the enemy follows...
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>If player is in the Defend Phase</h3>
    -If enemy has less than or equal to 6 health, it will use its phase to heal
    <br>
    -First Attack - Attack or heal, if points permit, depending on health
    <br>
    -If enemy has 5 or less points, it will wait through the phase
    <br>
    -Second Attack - It will then heal or skip, depending on health
    <br>
    -Max damage 0 (Thanks mechanics)
    <br>
    -Max Heal 10
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>If player is in the Wait Phase...</h3>
    -If enemy has less than or equal to 6 health, it will use its phase to heal
    <br>
    -Extra damage will be done in wait, up to 5 and down to 3
    <br>
    -First Attack - It will attack, wait or heal, depending on points, and do 5 damage
    <br>
    -Second Attack - It will attack or heal, depending on health and points, and do 3 damage
    <br>
    -Max damage 10
    <br>
    -Max Heal 5
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>If player is in the Attack Phase...</h3>
    -If enemy has less than or equal to 6 health, it will use its phase to heal
    <br>
    -Can do up to 10 damage, but it is random
    <br>
    -First Attack - Attack or heal, if points permit, depending on health will do random up to 10
    <br>
    -If the enemy has less than 8 health, it will heal instead
    <br>
    -Second Attack - It will then heal or skip, depending on health and phase
    <br>
    -Max damage 10
    <br>
    -Max Heal 10
    <br>
    -If the enemy doesn't have enough points for both attacks, it will only do one
    <br>
    <br>
    All of these changes to the enemy help the system feel a lot more varied since the enemy isn’t just slashing away doing the same attack every turn. Also, the enemy can heal itself now so defeating it isn’t as easy anymore.
    <br>
    <br>
    Pretty short update, just like the last but important none the less.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks for reading,
    <br>
    <br>
    Andy
