Welcome back everyone to Update 4 of Project Phases. These next two updates are 2 parts of the same update of Multiple Player Combat. Before this update, you could only fight with one character in your party at a time but now you can fight with three at once.<a href="update5.html">The next update</a>  will go over the enemy side of combat where you can fight three enemies at once. With that explanation out of the way, lets go over what’s new!
<br>
<br>
<h2>Main Menu Changes</h2>
In the "Setup" menu on the main menu, there is a new button called “Player Select”. Here you can select which character you use within the game. You have 3 characters, Daryl, Clint and Oliver. Daryl is a balanced character (and the character that was already in the game), Clint is the healer and Oliver is a tank like character. Each character works independently from each other; meaning if you only want to fight with Daryl you can.

<br>
<h2>Overworld Changes</h2>
Jumping into the game, you will instantly see the characters on the left-hand side of the screen. This is a temporary menu for the player stats until I get something a bit more official. The characters shown here will change depending if you have selected them in the menu discussed earlier.

<br>

<h2>Battle Changes</h2>
By far the biggest change with this update is the battles. When you engage in a battle, you will see all of your characters on the right side.

<br>
There are a lot of changes, so I am going to list them out here...
<br>
<br>
•	Everyone has a new skip button next to their character, clicking that will allow you to skip any phase you are in including the wait and defend phase. <br>
•	The attack menu now disappears whenever it is not in use.<br>
•	The attack menu is now outline with a color (either blue, green or red). This corresponds to one of the character’s shirt and helps you figure out who you are controlling.<br>
•	Depending on who is fighting, the positions of the players will always be centered<br>
•	The enemy attacks everyone at once now. This is temporary until I get all of the other enemies in but is something to note.<br>
•	Everyone now has a maximum health and cannot go over it.<br>
<br>
Since there are two new characters, I had to make new attacks for them. I made three attacks for each making six new attacks in total (nine attacks if we include Daryl). Here is a quick rundown of every character’s attacks and stats…
<br>
<br>
<h3>Characters-</h3>
•	Daryl – 25 Max Health, 8 Points, 10 Time<br>
•	Clint – 30 Max Health, 12 Points, 6 Time<br>
•	Oliver – 50 Max Health, 10 Points, 16 Time<br>
<br>
<h3>Attacks-</h3>
•	Slash (Daryl) – Does 10 damage, uses 3 Points and 5 Time. Does 2 damage in the defend phase.<br>
•	Fury(Daryl) – Does 15 damage, uses 5 Points and 7 Time.<br>
•	Heal (Daryl)- Heal 5 HP to whoever used it, uses 4 Points and 3 Time<br>
•	Wide Slash (Oliver) – Does 10 damage, uses 7 Points and 8 Time. Does damage to all enemies.<br>
•	Smash Down (Oliver) – Does 20 damage, uses 10 Points and 12 Time.<br>
•	Defense Break (Oliver) - Does 10 damage, uses 10 Points and 4 Time. Only work if hits in the Defend phase. If successfully hit in defend phase, it will make enemy’s defend phase act like a wait phase. (Demonstration below)<br>
•	Choice Heal – Heal 10 HP to whoever is selected, uses 5 Points and 2 Time.<br>
•	Party Heal – Heal 7 HP to the entire party, uses 8 Points and 5 Time.<br>
•	Living strike – Does a certain amount of damage depending on the health of the user. The lower the user’s health, the more powerful the attack. Uses 4 Points and 4 time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a .gif of Defense Break in action...

<br>
By far the hardest move to program was Choice Heal. This is because for it to work, you must select a player. Up to this point, you didn’t have to select anything, so this was a whole new system for me. It took quite a bit of time to get it working, but I am happy on how it turned out. I will also need it for the next update when you must select which enemy to attack for almost every move.
<br>
<br>
This has been the most difficult update yet. There is so many small things that had to be programmed in to get anything to work. There are a lot of bugs and glitches that still need to be figured out, and honestly, it’s a bit intimidating knowing I have to fix those. However, I am happy with the results and I am ready to keep it going with the next update.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading,
<br>
<br>
