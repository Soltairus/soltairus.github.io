  Hello everyone, welcome back to Project Phases. This is Update 6 which is filled with many general additions and bug fixes, mostly having to do with the Overworld. So let’s begin with the changes!
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Overworld Changes</h2>
  Jumping into the game you will immediately see a giant change with the new graphics. The overworld tiles have been completely revamped. A lot of the colors are much less saturated, and the tiles work well together. This is literally the best of my artistic ability and I am very proud of what I managed to do. I also gave Daryl a new overworld sprite, complete with awful animations!
  <br>
  <br>
	<img src="../../images/Updates/Update 6/update6_overworld.PNG" alt="Look at the new Overworld"  style="width:45%; height:45%; display: inline;">
	<img src="../../images/Updates/Update 6/update6_lake.PNG" alt="Look at the lake in the south part of the overworld"  style="width:45%; height:45%; display: inline; float: right;">
	<br>
  Along with the new graphics, the area has seen a few new additions. Near the bottom, there is a small lake that does absolutely nothing. On the path, you will see the new overworld sprite for Clockman. It looks awful, moving on. At the top there is a brand new and first of his kind NPC. His name is Alex and when you talk to him you will see another new addition, textboxes. Now, whenever you talk to something or interact with an object that has text connected to it, it will appear within textboxes. This applies to the signs we had in the game before which used to just place text wherever. You press “E” to interact, you can hold down “E” to speed the text up and you can press “E” one last time to close the textbox once all the text is finished scrolling through. Above anything you can interact with is a small “E” logo, which even fades out slightly when you touch it. If you talk to Alex multiple times, the text will be different.
  <br>
  <br>
  If you try to walk into Alex, you quickly realize you can’t. This shows off the new collision system. Now, there are certain things you cannot collide with in the game. For example, the lake at the bottom also has collision which stops you whenever you want to go for a swim. The only purpose of the lake is to test environmental collision, and it seems to work great!
  <br>
  <br>
  The next big change is the dash. If you press shift anywhere in the overworld, you will dash at great speed. I am going to change this into a roll later but until I can animate a roll, it will remain a dash. Once you dash, you will have to wait a few seconds until you can dash again. The game will make this loud, annoying sound when your dash has recharged; it will also show a small white star next to your character.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final overworld change is the new menu. If you press “I”, you will open a small menu on the left hand side of the screen. The only things in the menu are the “Party” tab and “Items” tab, with only the party tab being filled in with the player stats. I plan to in the next update work on an inventory system and work on filling in this menu. Until then, it doesn’t do much.
  <br>
  <br>

	<br>
  <h2>Battle Changes</h2>
  First, the arrow the goes across the timeline has changed slightly. This was due to a glitch that was caused the by old arrow collision, so I just ended up changing he whole arrow entirely.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next, the small skip button next to the characters now work when someone else is in their attack phase. This means if you want to skip with Clint when Daryl is choosing his attacks, you can. The small skip button can also be activated with the number keys now (1,2,3 for Daryl, Clint and Oliver respectively). This makes it way easier to make split second decisions when skipping. This makes skipping a much more viable options when making strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  And with that, we are done with this update. Lots of smaller things packed into one. It’s getting to the point where the updates get bigger in scope, but the visual progress get less. It is a weird situation. The next update should be about the item system and getting that working in the game. I’ll see you then.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks for reading,
  <br>
  <br>
  Andy
