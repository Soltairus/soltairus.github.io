    Okay, if you are a musician on YouTube listen up because I got something to say to you. If all your music is exclusively on YouTube and not on any other platform, you need to fix that now. I use Spotify daily and it works great. Spotify is meant for music and it does music very well. YouTube is meant for videos and it does videos very well. YouTube is not meant for music, so it doesn’t do music very well. See where I'm going with this?
    <br>
    <br>
    The problem with music on YouTube is that (unless you have YouTube Premium) it takes lot of cellular data. When I am out and about, I don’t have lots of data to lose on listening to music on YouTube. Since YouTube still streams a 1080p video (because YouTube is a <b>video platform</b>), even though it’s just music, it maxes out my data limit quickly. Spotify on the other hand doesn't have this problem since it only streams music. Smaller files to stream equals more data.
    <br>
    <br>
    Also, I like keeping everything in one place. I like my music on Spotify, my games on Steam, and my videos on YouTube. Everything has it’s place and everything just works better that way. When I have 95% of my music on Spotify and 5% on YouTube, it can get cumbersome very quickly. Same thing with game launchers and different streaming platforms etc.
    <br>
    <br>
    At the very least YouTube artists, put a download link to the song. If it is a Bandcamp link and I have to pay for it, it is much better than nothing; after all, if your music is really good I have no problem with supporting you. Once I have the song downloaded, it becomes much easier to implement your music into my system.
    <br>
    <br>
    I know there are alternative methods of getting the audio from a YouTube video, but honestly it would be easier for everyone if you just gave us other options to listen to it in the first place.
    <br>
    <br>
    While this post is directed to all YouTube artists, it specifically aimed towards <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/moonbowmusicmovie">moonbowmusicmovie</a>. You guys make some amazing stuff and it’s just a shame that I can’t easily fit It into my ecosystem of music. Then again, it really isn’t that hard to get it other way so in the long run it isn’t that big of a deal. Don't mean to sound rude, just some food for thought.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks for reading,
    <br>
    <br>
