		<p>Hello my name is Andy. I am a part-time game developer. Right now, I am working on Project Phases.
			<br>
			I started doing this about 4 years ago, working on small projects on my free time.
			Recently, Project Phases has become my main project.
			I hope to release Project Phases (with a different name of course) someday, so I hope you look forward to that.
			<br>
			Besides Phases, I have a few other projects I am working on. One of which is this website. If you want to learn more about
			this website and why it even exists or how it came to be, I have a dev-log about that <a href="devlog/devlog1.html">here</a>.
			</p>
			<br>

	<h2 id="page_header">What is Project Phases?</h2>
		<p>
			Project Phases is the main project I am working on. I wanted to make something unique and so far, I feel I have succeeded in that.
			If you want to learn more about the specifics of the game itself, click <a href="phases.html">here</a>.
			At the moment, I am the only person working on Project Phases besides a few of my friends who have helped me playtest and such.
			<h3 id="page_header">How do updates work?</h3>
			I release updates on this website, <a href="https://twitter.com/soltairus" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDMWA2XwUlxsRsmgY9oa7dg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
			Updates are split into 2 different categories, big updates and small updates (creative right?).
			Updates here will be the most detailed, getting into specific elements of an update. You can find those updates in the <a href="devlog.html">dev-log</a>.
			Twitter updates are short "Hey look at this" style of update. They don't get to specific, mostly because of the character limit.
			They also (from now on) have a link to the more in-depth version of the update on the website, once again in the <a href="devlog.html">dev-log</a> section.
			YouTube updates (and updates in the <a href="update.html">Phases Update</a> tab up above) are giant updates.
			These take months worth of work and puts all the newest features into one big update.
			These take a while, but help me stay on track with the updates and helps you get caught up to the newest version.
			I know this is more confusing than it should be, but I rather you have too much information than not enough.

			<h3 id="page_header">Why does the game look graphically bad?</h3>
			Short answer, I can't draw for the life of me. Visual art has always been my weakest link when it comes to making a game.
			However, right now I don't mind that much. I am more focused on the game itself rather than the way it looks.
			It could have the best graphics in the world, but no one would care if you could even walk without glitching out.
			My goal right now is to get a good foundation on Project Phases before I start worrying about graphics, story, music etc.
			I really hate the graphics. I want them to change as much as you do, trust me but now it is not a priority.
			The graphics will be changed, just not yet. Start the countdown now.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2 id="page_header">Why do you do reviews?</h2>
		<p>
			Every time I beat a game, whether its good or bad I always want to talk about it. So, while I thought about making a website, I realized I could put reviews here to.
			I don't know how frequent they will be, it depends on the game. I have three rules about reviews though.
			<ol>
				<li>I must beat a game before I review it.</li>
				<li>I disclose how much I spent on the game, so I can determine its value at both MSRP and what I got it for.</li>
				<li>I will not give a score (like 8.3/10).</li>
			</ol>
			First one is self-explanatory, it's only fair I give a fair shot to the game in question.
			The second one probably doesn't matter as much, but at the same time I think it's something important you should know going in.
			The third rule is a personal preference thing. I don't really understand how people manage to sum up an entire 100+ hour journey into a number.
			Just from experience, I have played many games that got great reviews that I didn't really like. This is fine, since it's up to every person to decide what types of games they like.
			If I put a number next to my review, I feel like it can be misleading and that's the last thing I want to do.
		</p>

		<br>

		<h2 id="page_header">What are the First Impressions?</h2>
		<p>
			Sometimes, I want to talk about a game before I beat it or I never beat a game but want to talk about it. In my rules for reviews, I say I have to beat the game I am reviewing, but that becomes a problem when the game is bad.
			First Impressions is a way to talk about the game, without reviewing it. I can point out my issues with the game or what I really liked about it and not have to worry about it being a complete review.
			Just because I make a First Impressions on a game, doesn't mean the game is bad or that I won't make a review of it once I am done however.
		</p>

		<br>
		<h2 id="page_header">Wow! This sounds great, how can I stay up to date with updates?</h2>
		<p>
			First, follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/soltairus" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. I will post smaller updates there, along with telling you when I post something on this website.
			Next, subscribe to me on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDMWA2XwUlxsRsmgY9oa7dg" target="_blank">YouTube</a> if you want the big updates.
			Note that I will post those big updates here too, with the YouTube video embedded so this isn't necessary if you check the website every once and a while (but you should do it anyways).
			Last follow me on Twitch, to watch my streams.
			<h3 id="page_header">Why do you have Twitch Streams?</h3>
			Twitch streams are great for a few reasons. For one, I record all my streams, so when I stream I can look back and see what I did.
			This really helps if I messed something up, but I don't know where. If I was streaming, I can just go back and watch it.
			"Why don't you record all the time then!" you might be asking. I would to be honest, but it is a waste of resources.
			It takes too much compute power to be recording for the sole purpose of probably getting deleted anyways. When I'm streaming however, I don't feel like my resources are being misused.
			Hopefully that makes sense. Also streaming is a good way to talk to you, and a good way to tell people about my game.
			Finally, streaming is just fun. It is way more entertaining when people are talking to you via chat, so thank you for that.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2 id="page_header">How can I contact you if need be?</h2>
		<p>
			The best solution would be through <a href="https://twitter.com/soltairus" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, either publicly or privately. I may make an email if people are constantly contacting me, but until that day comes I rather stay away from email.
			Other than Twitter, you could comment on a YouTube video or ask me directly during a livestream.
			Overall though, Twitter is your best bet.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2 id="page_header">Thank You</h2>
		<p>
			Last thing I want to say is thank you. It means so much to me that you care about this game and my projects.
			My goal is to release Phases so that passion doesn't go to waste for both you and me.
			<br>
			Thank you for stopping by.
			<br>
			Andy
