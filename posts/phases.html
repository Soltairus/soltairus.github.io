		<h1><a id="phases_battle">Battles</a></h1>
		<p>
			Battles are based on a real-time timeline system. The timeline is split into the Attack (Red), Wait (White) and Defend (Blue) phases with differnt things happening in each one.
			<div id="phases_battle">
			<div id="phases_battle"><img src="../images/phases_battle_battle.gif" alt="Battle"></div>
			<h2>Attack Phase</h2>
			<p>In the Attack phase, you can select your actions for that turn. This can include attacking, using items, waiting etc. Each character has their own unique attacks. You can do as many actions as you want given you have enough Time and Points. Mastering the attack phase is the key to victory.
			</p>
			<h2>Defend Phase</h2>
			<p>In the Defend phase, you will take little to no damage from attacks. Some attacks however can do massive damage in the Defend phase if you aren’t careful. Setting up your timeline to get hit in the defend phase is key to stay ahead of the curb. Think ahead and know your options to minimize damage.
			</p>
			<h2>Wait Phase</h2>
			<p>The wait phase is a resting phase for all character. Everyone is vulnerable in this phase and will take full damage if attacked. Minimizing the amount of time, you spend in the Wait phase is an important step to victory, though it’s much easier said than done.</p>
