  <!-- INTRO -->
  <p>
    I must admit, this title is a bit of a lie. This is my third time playing <i>Valkyria Chronicles</i>, starting back from the beginning to see if the game will finally click for me. For some reason, I’ve never been able to get into in. I am going to try one more time and see if I can get through this game, so here are my current First Impression (more like third impressions really) on <i>Valkyria Chronicles</i>.
    <br>
    <br>
    I first bought this game due to Steam giving me a random coupon for 75% off, meaning I got the game for $5.00. Even now, this was a good deal since this game barely ever goes under that price on sale. Overall, I like strategy games from Fire Emblem to X-COM to good old fashion Chess, so I knew what I was getting into when I bought it and my chances of liking it were very high.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Presentation</h2>
  <p>
    The game starts with a beautiful intro that showcases two major strengths, graphics and music. The presentation is impressive, especially for being a 10-year-old game. Seriously, look at gameplay for the recently released <i>Valkyria Chronicles 4</i> compared to this game, they look remarkably similar for having a decade gap between their releases, but that is just proof on how the water-color style looks. Besides a few lip-syncing anomalies, the game consistently looks great. The intro also showcases the fantastic music, with dramatic strings moving the entire game to another level. Almost every song I have heard so far, I have loved. It is a fantastic score that is criminally underrated.
    <br>
    <br>
    As you get into the game, you notice a few quirks with the interface. The whole story is told through a storybook. This storybook links together all your cutscenes, battles and things like that. I don’t hate the storybook design, but it has a few problems the biggest of which being the page select. It takes a minimum of three button presses to get anywhere that isn’t the page your already on. It might not sound like a big deal, but there always seems to be a delay in the button presses to let the animation play. You end up wasting lots of time just sitting for animations to finish. To make matters worse, you navigate through these menus all the time. This problem of everything taking too long to do persists in a many of the menus in the game. Once again, it’s more nitpicking than anything but it is something worth mentioning.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>
  The characters of <i>Valkyria Chronicles</i> is where the game really shines in my opinion. The main characters a fantastic, all with their different ideals and quirks. Side characters also get lots of development due to little biographies you can read about every character. Everyone is voice-acted, but it isn’t perfect. Any voicework that isn’t part of a cutscene tends to sound bland and uninteresting. The story itself is also pretty good so far. It focuses more on relationships between peoples and different stereotypes rather than an actual story. Worldbuilding can be found everywhere, if you are curious about something there is probably some text somewhere that can give you an answer. I already mentioned the tab with the character bios, but there is also a sort of newspaper you can read that gives you updates on what you have been doing and what else has been happening in the world. It’s a nice touch, and since most of the passages are short I tend to read them unlike other games where they want you to read a whole fifty-page essay about the lore of the world.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Gameplay</h2>
  <p>
    I left Gameplay for last intentionally, since its where I find it hard to really love this game. I’m not going to get into specifics but give a basic idea on how the battle system works. Battles start with you choosing your squad members to deploy on the field. There are five classes you can choose from, Scouts, Shock troopers, Lancers, Snipers and Engineers. Every class has their pros and cons, so choosing who to deploy is key to victory. You also get a tank, so that’s neat. You have a set amount of moves you can do in a turn, so using these wisely is also important. Every operation has an objective, and you win by completing said objective like defeating all the enemies or capturing a base.
    <br>
    <br>
    Overall, it’s a robust system that works well but it has some huge flaws that makes it hard for me to get into it. First, battles can get long, minimum of 20 minutes. This isn’t a bad thing, but something to important to note. Next, aiming is flawed in so many ways. It does the X-COM thing where whether you hit or not is pretty much all chance. You aim at the enemy with a circle of where the bullet will hit, so sometimes you will miss your target completely. This by itself is fine, but for some reason your bullet get weaker the farther away your aiming (unless you’re a sniper). While this logically makes sense, in the terms of gameplay it makes you have no incentive to even try to hit far away targets which defeats the purpose of having random accuracy. So most of the time you want to get up close to an enemy to defeat them, because if you don’t you will barely do any damage. When you get close to then however, they start to shoot at you almost instantly (except Lancers and Snipers). They will stop shooting at you if you aim your gun (logic right). The problem is it takes a while for them to stop shooting, especially shock troopers and by the time you get even remotely close you are either almost out of health or dead entirely. It makes attacking enemies needlessly frustrating, making me feel like I’m doing something wrong because all my people keep dying; and if I attack from afar, I can never kill them.
    <br>
    <br>
    My other big issue is the one hit game over screens. Let me explain. Remember I mentioned how you get a tank that you can use. The tank is awesome and becomes one of your best weapons. However, you <b>cannot lose the tank</b>. If you do, it is game over and you must start the whole mission back from the beginning which is awful in a 30-minute battle. To make matters even worse, this tank has a 1-hit KO weak spot which is located on the back of the tank. Okay, just don’t leave the backside of the tank exposed right? It seems simple, especially since enemy tanks have this same weak spot. I have had the weirdest thing happen to me twice now on Chapter 6. I get hit head on from the front at full health and get 1-hit KOed as if I got hit in the weak spot. I don’t know if it’s some weird glitch of something, but the fact that your whole match could end due to one weak spot is aggravating. Because of these mechanics, your main goal most of the time is defend the tank and it slows down gameplay to a halt.
    <br>
    <br>
    Since your whole party is gathered around the slow-moving tank, making sure nothing can touch it, you end up taking forever to get anywhere making the long battles even longer. It also means slow moving units like Lancers and Snipers almost always get left behind at camp since they can’t keep up with the tank. While the tank is neat, I don’t think the whole game should be centered around it and keeping it safe.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    In conclusion, I don’t know how much more of this game I am going to play. The gameplay annoyances are starting to show up and it reminds me how much I just don’t want to deal with them. While pretty much everything else about <i>Valkyria Chronicles</i> is fantastic, I don’t think I will be sticking around with it much longer.
